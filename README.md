# GPSI Course at ESEN
GPSI (Computer Systems Management and Programming) Course at ESEN schools and contain Exercises and Projects.<br> 
Attention: 
-The files/exercises/projects in this repository are all in Portuguese(Portugal), because the professional course that I @SimaDinisVC took was precisely in Portugal.
-We learned about algorithm but I lost my exercises by problems.
-I used a pdf translator to translate from the portuguese language to the English language but the pdf english version was unformatted so i made the pdf's of both languages available.
